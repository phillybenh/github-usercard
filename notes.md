- _Asynchroous Code_
  - async code is code that is not run instantly in line
  - the code out be waiting for something to happen (event?) or waiting for data to be returned form a server
  - Example:
    - `setTimeout( () => {console.log('Hello!');}, 1000);` //asynch, waits 1 second to run
    - `console.log('Over here!');` //runs imediately
- There are multiple ways to approach asynchronous code -two are:
  - `async/await` and `Promises`
- _Promises_

  - Promises are a design patern used for handlilng async code in JS
  - Promises are used instead of multiple nested callbacks - avoiding "callback hell"
  - Promisces are not used frequently in frontend development, but it's important to understand how they work adn how to deal with them
  - Promisces are used for requesting data from web servers
  - Two methods used for handling Promises:
    - `.then()`
    - `.catch()`
  - For transfering data from our app and a web server we'll use `Promise Library`
  - From MDN:
    " A Promise is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. It allows you to associate handlers with an asynchronous actionâ€™s eventual success value or failure reason. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead of immediately returning the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise to supply the value at some point in the future."
  - A Promise can exist in one of three states:
    - `Pending`
    - `Fulfilled`
    - `Rejected`
  - If the Promise succeeds, it will return the value as a parameter into a callback passed into `.then()`
  - If the Promise fails, the callback passed into the `.catch()` runs, taking an error as an argument

- _HTTP_
  - We'll be requesting data from servers using HTTP and a library called `axios`
  - HTTP - HyperTextTransferProtocol
    - CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete
    - HTTP Methods provide a common language to let the server know what we want to perform
    - GET Request - asking the server for information by specifying a URL that points to the desired resource
    - POST Request - used to aske server to create a new resource
    - PUT Request - asking server to chaneg a specific resource
    - Delete Request - asking server to delete data
    - HTTP Status Codes are used to indicate if a request has been successful or not and why
  - axios
    _ axios is a JS library used for sending HTTP requests to servers
    _ axios is not nescessary, but makes it much easier

    let newButton = document.createElement('button');
    newButton.textContent = buttonTitle;
    newButton.classList.add('button');
    
    return newButton;
}

   axios.get('http://fakeserver.com/data')
    .then( response => {
        // Remember response is an object, response.data is an array.
        response.data.forEach( item => {
            let button = buttonCreator(item);
            parent.appendChild(button);
        })
    })
    .catch( error => {
        console.log("Error:", err);
    })
